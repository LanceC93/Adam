I made this project because at some point in the future, I would like to try to emulate culture. That is beyond what I can do for this project, so I broke it down to a very basic element of culture, the need to survive that each individual has. This project is meant to show a model trying its best to "survive" by playing a game where it has to keep its resources up, while the food supply is limited.

The main issue I encountered was unfamiliarity with q-tables, pygame, and gymnasium. They are all tools I have never used before, so it ate up a lot of my time trying to figure out how to use them. I overcame it by reading a lot of code and trying to make my code do the same thing. It did cause me to not finish though, unfortunately.

Libraries Used: gym, pygame, numpy
